## tld_info
This was made out of my person curiousity. I was looking at the list of all the
companies who manager top-level domains. (e.g: .biz, .fun, etc) and I wondered
how many and which ones did Amazon own.

**USAGE**: `./tld_info your_query`

This currently has a bunch of bugs, and only works if you know the official name
of the company that managers the domain. For example, Google is represented at
'Charleston Road Registry Inc.' (Who would have known that?).

The data comes from [https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db](here).
